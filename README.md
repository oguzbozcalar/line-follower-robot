# 🤖 Arduino Line Follower Robot

An autonomous **line follower robot** built using Arduino. The robot follows a black line on a white surface using infrared (IR) sensors and adjusts motor direction accordingly.

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a basic line follower robot using Arduino, IR sensors, and a motor driver. The robot detects the path using IR sensors and corrects its movement in real-time to stay on the line.
